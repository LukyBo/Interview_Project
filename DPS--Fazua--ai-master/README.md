# Fazua - AI Model

The code in this repository provides a method to predict the power output of a Fazua E-MTB and the energy needed from the battery. 
The output of the model is the State of Charge (SOC). 
Explanation of the different SOCs:
  1. SOC > 0. A positive SOC means that you are good to go and don't need an additional battery. 
  2. -1 < SOC < 0. A SOC between -1 and 0 means that you need one additional battery to be able to make the trip. 
  3. SOC < -1. A SOC smaller than -1 means that you need more than one additional battery. It is not recommended to make the tour.
  

# Running the Model/Code
Option 1: Testing with Postman
The results are generated by executing the "main.py" file.

Postman settings: 
- "POST" method
- Body: "form-data"
- KEY: "file"
- VALUE: Insert .gpx file
